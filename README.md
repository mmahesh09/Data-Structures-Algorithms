### Arrays and Lists üìã

**Description**: Arrays and lists are basic data structures that store collections of elements. In Python, lists are dynamic and can hold elements of different types. Arrays, on the other hand, are fixed-size and require the use of libraries like NumPy for implementation.

**Uses**: Suitable for scenarios where you need to store and access a collection of items. Examples include storing user data, handling large datasets, and implementing simple algorithms.

### Stacks ü•û

**Description**: A stack is a data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are added and removed from the same end, known as the top of the stack.

**Uses**: Useful for tasks such as function call management, undo mechanisms in applications, and parsing expressions.
